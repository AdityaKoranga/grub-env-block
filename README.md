## Prerequisites

## Resolution Steps

Zero out the grubenv file:

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/boot/grub2/grubenv bs=1 count=1024
```

Set the grubenv file to a proper format:
This will initialize the grubenv file with the default settings.

```bash
sudo grub2-editenv /boot/grub2/grubenv create
```

Generate the GRUB Configuration Again:
After fixing the grubenv file, regenerate the GRUB configuration.

```bash
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```
